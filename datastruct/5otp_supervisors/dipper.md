Thank you. Let's begin your assessment on Supervisors.

Please provide a detailed explanation of the purpose of Supervisors.

You said:
supervisors in elixir monitor and manage other processes to keep the system stable. if a process crashes, the supervisor restarts it based on predefined rules. this helps applications recover from errors automatically and stay running without manual fixes.

Thank you for your response.

Now, please provide a complete example of how Supervisors are applied in practice. Remember to avoid code, code-like symbols, and analogies. Use clear, plain language to describe the example.

You said:
a supervisor can be used in an application that handles user sessions. when a user logs in, a new process is started to manage their session data, like tracking activity or saving preferences. the supervisor keeps track of these session processes. if one of them fails, such as because of bad data or a timeout, the supervisor automatically starts a new session process so that the system keeps working. this setup allows many sessions to run independently and ensures that one failure does not affect the others or crash the whole application.
