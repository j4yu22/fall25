a gen_statem can manage a traffic light system by defining states like green, yellow, and red, and controlling how the system moves between them. each state has rules for timing and transitions, ensuring lights change safely and predictably. it can also handle unexpected events, such as malfunctions or manual overrides, while keeping the system stable and consistent.

Now, explain the purpose of this topic in detail, using plain and precise language. Avoid including any code, code-like references, or figurative comparisons.

You said:
the purpose of a gen_statem is to manage systems that change behavior based on their current state. it provides a structured way to define states, specify how to move between them, and handle events differently depending on which state the system is in. this helps developers build reliable and organized systems where actions depend on context, such as handling input, timing, or conditions in a clear and consistent way.
